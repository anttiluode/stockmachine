## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run **Stock Machine!** on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anttiluode/stockmachine.git
cd stock-machine
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate

source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have pip installed, then install the required packages:

bash

4. Initialize the Database
The application uses SQLite for data storage. Initialize the database by running the application once, which will automatically create the necessary tables.

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Close the application after the initial run to proceed to the next steps.

5. Configure Admin Credentials
By default, the admin password is set to admin123. For security, it's recommended to change this password.

Open the app.py file.
Locate the admin_panel function.
Replace "admin123" with your desired secure password.
python
Copy code
hashed_admin_password = hash_password("your_secure_password")  # Replace with your secure admin password
6. (Optional) Add a Custom Frame
If you wish to overlay a custom PNG frame over the app:

Place your PNG file (e.g., slot_frame.png) in the assets/ directory.
Uncomment and update the set_custom_frame line in the main function.
python
Copy code
# set_custom_frame("assets/slot_frame.png")
As of now this function has been commented (#) out.
